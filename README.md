**Random Number Guessing**:

The program will ask the player to provide the lower and upper bounds for a number which will be generated randomly. The player will also provide the number of chances they will have to guess the random number correctly. After each guess, the player will be notified if the guess is correct or whether the number guessed is lower or higher compared to the randomly generated number.
